# 🛒 Telegram Shopping List Bot

A lightweight, user-friendly Telegram chatbot that helps users manage their shopping lists efficiently.
The bot supports adding, viewing, deleting, and marking items as bought, with a clean UX and scalable backend architecture.


## System requirements

* Node.js >= 18.x
* npm >= 9.x
* Telegram account
* Telegram Bot Token (via @BotFather)


## 🧩 Core Components

1. **Handlers**

* Handle Telegram updates (messages & callback queries)
* Manage user interaction and UX
* Never access the database directly


2. **Services**

* Contain business logic
* Coordinate repositories and caching
* Easy to unit test


3. **Repositories**

* Execute SQL queries
* Encapsulate database access
* No Telegram or UI logic


4. **Cache Layer**

* Stores telegram_id → user_id mappings
* Uses Memcached with 1-hour TTL
* Best-effort: failures never block user actions


## Supported Functionality

1. **➕ Add Items**

* Users can add one or multiple items
* Items are added incrementally without reopening the menu
* Clean confirmation after each item


2. **📋 View List**

* Displays all shopping list items
* Clearly indicates bought vs unbought items
* Uses emojis for clarity and readability


3. **🗑️ Delete Items**

* Displays items as inline buttons
* Supports deleting multiple items
* Deleted items are visually disabled in the UI


4. **✅ Mark as Bought**

* Items can be marked as bought individually
* Button is updated and disabled after successful action
* Remaining items stay interactive
